# Passwordless X1280

## Introduction to Passwordless X1280
Passwordless X1280 is a passwordless software provided free of charge by the Passwordless Alliance to B2C online services worldwide. Developed based on the international standard ITU X.1280, Passwordless X1280 consists of server software for online service providers and a mobile app for online service users.

When online service providers and users adopt Passwordless X1280, users no longer need to remember and enter passwords for online services. Instead, the online service presents an automatic password to the user, who verifies it using the mobile app to log in to the online service. Passwordless X1280 shifts the responsibility of password proof from the user to the online service’s automatic password proof method, allowing users to access online services conveniently and securely.

Moreover, it enables out-of-band biometric authentication for all B2C online services using the biometric sensors on the user’s smartphone, eliminating the need for separate biometric sensors on each user device. Passwordless X1280 meets the needs of usability, security, and cost-effectiveness for both B2C online services and users, providing a free passwordless software.

## Passwordless X1280 app

Users can manage Passwordless for all their online services with one app.
+ You can download the Passwordless X1280 app by scanning the QR code image below with your mobile device's camera.
